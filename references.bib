  year         = {2016},
  abstract     = {Recently, social phenomena have received a lot of attention not only from social scientists, but also from physicists, mathematicians and computer scientists, in the emerging interdisciplinary field of complex system science. Opinion dynamics is one of the processes studied, since opinions are the drivers of human behaviour, and play a crucial role in many global challenges that our complex world and societies are facing: global financial crises, global pandemics, growth of cities, urbanisation and migration patterns, and last but not least important, climate change and environmental sustainability and protection. Opinion formation is a complex process affected by the interplay of different elements, including the individual predisposition, the influence of positive and negative peer interaction (social networks playing a crucial role in this respect), the information each individual is exposed to, and many others. Several models inspired from those in use in physics have been developed to encompass many of these elements, and to allow for the identification of the mechanisms involved in the opinion formation process and the understanding of their role, with the practical aim of simulating opinion formation and spreading under various conditions. These modelling schemes range from binary simple models such as the voter model, to multi-dimensional continuous approaches. Here, we provide a review of recent methods, focusing on models employing both peer interaction and external information, and emphasising the role that less studied mechanisms, such as disagreement, has in driving the opinion dynamics.

Although the degree distribution and the average path length admit straightforward generalizations, for the clustering coefficient several different definitions have been proposed in the literature. We examined the different definitions and identified the similarities and differences between them. In order to elucidate the significance of different definitions of the weighted clustering coefficient, we studied their dependence on the weights of the connections. For this purpose, we introduce the relative perturbation norm of the weights as an index to assess the weight distribution. This study revealed new interesting statistical regularities in terms of the relative perturbation norm useful for the statistical characterization of weighted graphs.},

  abstract    = {This paper is an extensive survey of literature on complex network communities and clustering. Complex networks describe a widespread variety of systems in nature and society especially systems composed by a large number of highly interconnected dynamical entities. Complex networks like real networks can also have community structure. There are several types of methods and algorithms for detection and identification of communities in complex networks. Several complex networks have the property of clustering or network transitivity. Some of the important concepts in the field of complex networks are small-world and scale-robustness, degree distributions, clustering, network correlations, random graph models, models of network growth, dynamical processes on networks, etc. Some current areas of research on complex network communities are those on community evolution, overlapping communities, communities in directed networks, community characterization and interpretation, etc. Many of the algorithms or methods proposed for network community detection through clustering are modified versions of or inspired from the concepts of minimum-cut based algorithms, hierarchical connectivity based algorithms, the original GirvanNewman algorithm, concepts of modularity maximization, algorithms utilizing metrics from information and coding theory, and clique based algorithms.},

We characterize the geometrical properties resulting from the coexistence of a local structure and random long-range connections, and we examine their evolution with size and disorder strength. We show that any finite value of the disorder is able to trigger a ``small-world'' behaviour as soon as the initial lattice is big enough, and study the crossover between a regular lattice and a ``small-world'' one. These results are corroborated by the investigation of an Ising model defined on the network, showing for every finite disorder fraction a crossover from a high-temperature region dominated by the underlying one-dimensional structure to a mean-field like low-temperature region. In particular there exists a finite-temperature ferromagnetic phase transition as soon as the disorder strength is finite.},

  abstract    = {Stochastic block models (SBMs) are often used to find assortative community structures in networks, such that the probability of connections within communities is higher than in between communities. However, classic SBMs are not limited to assortative structures. In this study, we discuss the implications of this model-inherent indifference towards assortativity or disassortativity, and show that this characteristic can lead to undesirable outcomes for networks which are presupposedy assortative but which contain a reduced amount of information. To circumvent this issue, we introduce a constrained SBM that imposes strong assortativity constraints, along with efficient algorithmic approaches to solve it. These constraints significantly boost community recovery capabilities in regimes that are close to the information-theoretic threshold. They also permit to identify structurally-different communities in networks representing cerebral-cortex activity regions.},
