  abstract     = {Recently, social phenomena have received a lot of attention not only from social scientists, but also from physicists, mathematicians and computer scientists, in the emerging interdisciplinary field of complex system science. Opinion dynamics is one of the processes studied, since opinions are the drivers of human behaviour, and play a crucial role in many global challenges that our complex world and societies are facing: global financial crises, global pandemics, growth of cities, urbanisation and migration patterns, and last but not least important, climate change and environmental sustainability and protection. Opinion formation is a complex process affected by the interplay of different elements, including the individual predisposition, the influence of positive and negative peer interaction (social networks playing a crucial role in this respect), the information each individual is exposed to, and many others. Several models inspired from those in use in physics have been developed to encompass many of these elements, and to allow for the identification of the mechanisms involved in the opinion formation process and the understanding of their role, with the practical aim of simulating opinion formation and spreading under various conditions. These modelling schemes range from binary simple models such as the voter model, to multi-dimensional continuous approaches. Here, we provide a review of recent methods, focusing on models employing both peer interaction and external information, and emphasising the role that less studied mechanisms, such as disagreement, has in driving the opinion dynamics.

Although the degree distribution and the average path length admit straightforward generalizations, for the clustering coefficient several different definitions have been proposed in the literature. We examined the different definitions and identified the similarities and differences between them. In order to elucidate the significance of different definitions of the weighted clustering coefficient, we studied their dependence on the weights of the connections. For this purpose, we introduce the relative perturbation norm of the weights as an index to assess the weight distribution. This study revealed new interesting statistical regularities in terms of the relative perturbation norm useful for the statistical characterization of weighted graphs.},

  abstract    = {This paper is an extensive survey of literature on complex network communities and clustering. Complex networks describe a widespread variety of systems in nature and society especially systems composed by a large number of highly interconnected dynamical entities. Complex networks like real networks can also have community structure. There are several types of methods and algorithms for detection and identification of communities in complex networks. Several complex networks have the property of clustering or network transitivity. Some of the important concepts in the field of complex networks are small-world and scale-robustness, degree distributions, clustering, network correlations, random graph models, models of network growth, dynamical processes on networks, etc. Some current areas of research on complex network communities are those on community evolution, overlapping communities, communities in directed networks, community characterization and interpretation, etc. Many of the algorithms or methods proposed for network community detection through clustering are modified versions of or inspired from the concepts of minimum-cut based algorithms, hierarchical connectivity based algorithms, the original GirvanNewman algorithm, concepts of modularity maximization, algorithms utilizing metrics from information and coding theory, and clique based algorithms.},

We characterize the geometrical properties resulting from the coexistence of a local structure and random long-range connections, and we examine their evolution with size and disorder strength. We show that any finite value of the disorder is able to trigger a ``small-world'' behaviour as soon as the initial lattice is big enough, and study the crossover between a regular lattice and a ``small-world'' one. These results are corroborated by the investigation of an Ising model defined on the network, showing for every finite disorder fraction a crossover from a high-temperature region dominated by the underlying one-dimensional structure to a mean-field like low-temperature region. In particular there exists a finite-temperature ferromagnetic phase transition as soon as the disorder strength is finite.},

  abstract    = {Stochastic block models (SBMs) are often used to find assortative community structures in networks, such that the probability of connections within communities is higher than in between communities. However, classic SBMs are not limited to assortative structures. In this study, we discuss the implications of this model-inherent indifference towards assortativity or disassortativity, and show that this characteristic can lead to undesirable outcomes for networks which are presupposedy assortative but which contain a reduced amount of information. To circumvent this issue, we introduce a constrained SBM that imposes strong assortativity constraints, along with efficient algorithmic approaches to solve it. These constraints significantly boost community recovery capabilities in regimes that are close to the information-theoretic threshold. They also permit to identify structurally-different communities in networks representing cerebral-cortex activity regions.},

In reviewing this decade of research, we discuss recent advancements in applied studies of complex contagions, particularly in the domains of health, innovation diffusion, social media, and politics. We also discuss how these empirical studies have spurred complementary advancements in the theoretical modeling of contagions, which concern the effects of network topology on diffusion, as well as the effects of individual-level attributes and thresholds. In synthesizing these developments, we suggest three main directions for future research. The first concerns the study of how multiple contagions interact within the same network and across networks, in what may be called an ecology of contagions. The second concerns the study of how the structure of thresholds and their behavioral consequences can vary by individual and social context. The third area concerns the roles of diversity and homophily in the dynamics of complex contagion, including both diversity of demographic profiles among local peers, and the broader notion of structural diversity within a network. Throughout this discussion, we make an effort to highlight the theoretical and empirical opportunities that lie ahead.},

  abstract      = {Recent studies have shown that online users tend to select information adhering to their system of beliefs, ignore information that does not, and join groups - i.e., echo chambers - around a shared narrative. Although a quantitative methodology for their identification is still missing, the phenomenon of echo chambers is widely debated both at scientific and political level. To shed light on this issue, we introduce an operational definition of echo chambers and perform a massive comparative analysis on more than 1B pieces of contents produced by 1M users on four social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and Gab. We infer the leaning of users about controversial topics - ranging from vaccines to abortion - and reconstruct their interaction networks by analyzing different features, such as shared links domain, followed pages, follower relationship and commented posts. Our method quantifies the existence of echo-chambers along two main dimensions: homophily in the interaction networks and bias in the information diffusion toward likely-minded peers. We find peculiar differences across social media. Indeed, while Facebook and Twitter present clear-cut echo chambers in all the observed dataset, Reddit and Gab do not. Finally, we test the role of the social media platform on news consumption by comparing Reddit and Facebook. Again, we find support for the hypothesis that platforms implementing news feed algorithms like Facebook may elicit the emergence of echo-chambers.},

Despite increasing efforts, the dynamics leading to the emergence of these phenomena stay unclear. We propose a model that introduces the dynamics of radicalization, as a reinforcing mechanism driving the evolution to extreme opinions from moderate initial conditions. Inspired by empirical findings on social interaction dynamics, we consider agents characterized by heterogeneous activities and homophily. We show that the transition between a global consensus and emerging radicalized states is mostly governed by social influence and by the controversialness of the topic discussed. Compared with empirical data of polarized debates on Twitter, the model qualitatively reproduces the observed relation between users' engagement and opinions, as well as opinion segregation in the interaction network. Our findings shed light on the mechanisms that may lie at the core of the emergence of echo chambers and polarization in social media.},

  abstract      = {The flow of information reaching us via the online media platforms is optimized not by the information content or relevance but by popularity and proximity to the target. This is typically performed in order to maximise platform usage. As a side effect, this introduces an algorithmic bias that is believed to enhance polarization of the societal debate. To study this phenomenon, we modify the well-known continuous opinion dynamics model of bounded confidence in order to account for the algorithmic bias and investigate its consequences. In the simplest version of the original model the pairs of discussion participants are chosen at random and their opinions get closer to each other if they are within a fixed tolerance level. We modify the selection rule of the discussion partners: there is an enhanced probability to choose individuals whose opinions are already close to each other, thus mimicking the behavior of online media which suggest interaction with similar peers. As a result we observe: a) an increased tendency towards polarization, which emerges also in conditions where the original model would predict convergence, and b) a dramatic slowing down of the speed at which the convergence at the asymptotic state is reached, which makes the system highly unstable. Polarization is augmented by a fragmented initial population.},

  abstract      = {Nowadays, artificial intelligence algorithms are used for targeted and personalized content distribution in the large scale as part of the intense competition for attention in the digital media environment. Unfortunately, targeted information dissemination may result in intellectual isolation and discrimination. Further, as demonstrated in recent political events in the US and EU, malicious bots and social media users can create and propagate targeted `fake news' content in different forms for political gains. From the other direction, fake news detection algorithms attempt to combat such problems by identifying misinformation and fraudulent user profiles. This paper reviews common news feed algorithms as well as methods for fake news detection, and we discuss how news feed algorithms could be misused to promote falsified content, affect news diversity, or impact credibility. We review how news feed algorithms and recommender engines can enable confirmation bias to isolate users to certain news sources and affecting the perception of reality. As a potential solution for increasing user awareness of how content is selected or sorted, we argue for the use of interpretable and explainable news feed algorithms. We discuss how improved user awareness and system transparency could mitigate unwanted outcomes of echo chambers and bubble filters in social media.},

  month         = jul,
  abstract      = {Personalized recommendation benefits users in accessing contents of interests effectively. Current research on recommender systems mostly focuses on matching users with proper items based on user interests. However, significant efforts are missing to understand how the recommendations influence user preferences and behaviors, e.g., if and how recommendations result in \textit{echo chambers}. Extensive efforts have been made in examining the phenomenon in online media and social network systems. Meanwhile, there are growing concerns that recommender systems might lead to the self-reinforcing of user's interests due to narrowed exposure of items, which may be the potential cause of echo chamber. In this paper, we aim to analyze the echo chamber phenomenon in Alibaba Taobao -- one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world. Echo chamber means the effect of user interests being reinforced through repeated exposure to similar contents. Based on the definition, we examine the presence of echo chamber in two steps. First, we explore whether user interests have been reinforced. Second, we check whether the reinforcement results from the exposure of similar contents. Our evaluations are enhanced with robust metrics, including cluster validity and statistical significance. Experiments are performed on extensive collections of real-world data consisting of user clicks, purchases, and browse logs from Alibaba Taobao. Evidence suggests the tendency of echo chamber in user click behaviors, while it is relatively mitigated in user purchase behaviors. Insights from the results guide the refinement of recommendation algorithms in real-world e-commerce systems.},
