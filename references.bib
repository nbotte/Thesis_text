  title        = {Opinion dynamics: models, extensions and external effects},
  year         = {2016},
  abstract     = {Recently, social phenomena have received a lot of attention not only from social scientists, but also from physicists, mathematicians and computer scientists, in the emerging interdisciplinary field of complex system science. Opinion dynamics is one of the processes studied, since opinions are the drivers of human behaviour, and play a crucial role in many global challenges that our complex world and societies are facing: global financial crises, global pandemics, growth of cities, urbanisation and migration patterns, and last but not least important, climate change and environmental sustainability and protection. Opinion formation is a complex process affected by the interplay of different elements, including the individual predisposition, the influence of positive and negative peer interaction (social networks playing a crucial role in this respect), the information each individual is exposed to, and many others. Several models inspired from those in use in physics have been developed to encompass many of these elements, and to allow for the identification of the mechanisms involved in the opinion formation process and the understanding of their role, with the practical aim of simulating opinion formation and spreading under various conditions. These modelling schemes range from binary simple models such as the voter model, to multi-dimensional continuous approaches. Here, we provide a review of recent methods, focusing on models employing both peer interaction and external information, and emphasising the role that less studied mechanisms, such as disagreement, has in driving the opinion dynamics.

Complex networks have fared extremely well in both of these aspects, with their sound theoretical basis developed over the years and with a variety of applications. In this survey, we analyze the applications of complex networks to real-world problems and data, with emphasis in representation, analysis and modeling, after an introduction to the main concepts and models. A diversity of phenomena are surveyed, which may be classified into no less than 22 areas, providing a clear indication of the impact of the field of complex networks.},

  abstract    = {The purpose of this paper is to assess the statistical characterization of weighted networks in terms of the generalization of the relevant parameters, namely average path length, degree distribution and clustering coefficient. Although the degree distribution and the average path length admit straightforward generalizations, for the clustering coefficient several different definitions have been proposed in the literature. We examined the different definitions and identified the similarities and differences between them. In order to elucidate the significance of different definitions of the weighted clustering coefficient, we studied their dependence on the weights of the connections. For this purpose, we introduce the relative perturbation norm of the weights as an index to assess the weight distribution. This study revealed new interesting statistical regularities in terms of the relative perturbation norm useful for the statistical characterization of weighted graphs.},

  abstract    = {This paper is an extensive survey of literature on complex network communities and clustering. Complex networks describe a widespread variety of systems in nature and society especially systems composed by a large number of highly interconnected dynamical entities. Complex networks like real networks can also have community structure. There are several types of methods and algorithms for detection and identification of communities in complex networks. Several complex networks have the property of clustering or network transitivity. Some of the important concepts in the field of complex networks are small-world and scale-robustness, degree distributions, clustering, network correlations, random graph models, models of network growth, dynamical processes on networks, etc. Some current areas of research on complex network communities are those on community evolution, overlapping communities, communities in directed networks, community characterization and interpretation, etc. Many of the algorithms or methods proposed for network community detection through clustering are modified versions of or inspired from the concepts of minimum-cut based algorithms, hierarchical connectivity based algorithms, the original GirvanNewman algorithm, concepts of modularity maximization, algorithms utilizing metrics from information and coding theory, and clique based algorithms.},
